# JSONView-for-Chrome

JSONView-for-Chrome is an extension of chrome created by [gildas-lormeau](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/JSONView-for-Chrome) 
which is very useful for people who deals a lot with json type http requests.

But sometimes we would like to handle with our own json data, not from the internet. So I added a json editor to this extension
to make it more handful. The json editor is copied from [josdejong's jsoneditor](https://github.com/josdejong/jsoneditor).

I found this project at http://www.aneasystone.com/archives/2015/07/second-chrome-extension-jsonview-enhencement.html, aneasystone's blog.

All I did is just modify the style of the page to make it look better.
